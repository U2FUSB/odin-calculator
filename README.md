## TODOs
###### STAGE 5: Finalizing
FUNCTIONAL
- the "clear" button clears also all variables. You basically start fresh
- some input handling
  - dividing by 0 is not allowed. Results in an Error FOR THE USER
  - Errors are correcty displayed using the principle: garbage-in, garbage-out
  - Entering operators after each other just overwrites the last operator
  - make sure the tests work
###### STAGE 6: The Extra
- add `.` input to allow for floats as input. Make sure input is checked if floats are syntactically correct
- add possibility to remove misspellings using a `DEL` button
- add a +/- button as number button (maybe replace the 00)
- make 1.2 button work as intended
- keyboard support. (GG for that bro...)
- make calculator functionally extensible
- simplify css and make equal sign extensible
